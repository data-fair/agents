/**
 * One stateful test run at a time against the dev stack.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The api and e2e projects share one database, and every spec starts with `clean()`,
 * which deletes every `test*` document — settings, conversations, runs, usage. Playwright serialises
 * tests WITHIN a run (`workers: 1`), but nothing stopped a SECOND run: its `clean()` lands in the middle
 * of the first run's tests and deletes what they just seeded. The result looked exactly like product
 * flakiness — a different pair of failures each time, every one passing alone, typically a 403 because
 * a spec's own quota settings had vanished between seeding them and using them. It was proven by
 * running two api suites on purpose: 4 and 8 failures, against 0 in four runs one at a time.
 *
 * The second run was usually an agent launching a run in the background while an earlier one was
 * still going. So this refuses, loudly and immediately, rather than letting the two corrupt each other
 * and leaving someone to chase failures that never reproduce.
 *
 * Taken by the `state-setup` project, so only runs that touch the database take it: a unit-only run
 * neither needs it nor waits for it.
